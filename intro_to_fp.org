* What is FP?

* What is a value?

A value is the final result of a computation.

The value of 1 + 1 is 2.

* What is an expression?

A symbol or combination of symbols that represents a value or a
relationship between values

1 + 1 is an expression, it reduces to the value 2.

2 is also an expression as well as a value.

* What is evaluation?

Evaluation is the reduction of an expression to its value.

Evaluate:
e- (ex-, out) + value
"To extract the value"

Example of evaluation:
#+BEGIN_SRC python
1 + 1 + 1
1 + 2
3
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC
+------------+
| Expression |
+------------+
      |
      V
+------------+
| Evaluation |
+------------+
      |
      V
+------------+
|   Value    |
+------------+
#+END_SRC

* What is a variable?

A variable is a reference to a value.

In:
#+BEGIN_SRC python
a = 2
#+END_SRC
a is a variable, referencing the value 2

* What are side-effects?

A side effect is a step in the evaluation of an expression that has
effects outside of the expression itself.

Examples:
#+BEGIN_SRC python
print "hello"

a = 1; a += 1
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC
+------------+
| Expression |
+------------+
      |
      V
+------------+
| Evaluation |~~~> Side Effect
+------------+
      |
      V
+------------+
|   Value    |
+------------+
#+END_SRC

* Statement

A statement is an expression that evaluates to nothing.

** In Python:

Expression:
#+BEGIN_SRC python
a = 1 + 1
a = lambda x: x ** 2
#+END_SRC

Statement:
#+BEGIN_SRC python
if True:
  a = "hello"
else:
  a = "goodbye"
#+END_SRC

** In Clojure and Haskell

Only expressions
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(def a
  (if true "hello" "goodbye"))
#+END_SRC
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
a = if True
    then "hello"
    else "goodbye"
#+END_SRC

** Why is that?

Statements require side effects,
intrinsically imperative.

#+BEGIN_SRC
+------------+
| Expression |
+------------+
      |
      V
+------------+
| Evaluation |~~~> Side Effect
+------------+
      |
      X
#+END_SRC

* What is a function?

An abstraction for an expression, where one or several values in the
expression are replaced by variables.

Let's abstract the following expression:
#+BEGIN_SRC python
1 + 1

def inc (x):
  return x + 1

inc = lambda x: x + 1
#+END_SRC
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(+ 1 1)
(def inc (fn [x] (+ x 1)))
(defn inc [x] (+ x 1))
#+END_SRC
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
1 + 1
inc = \x -> x + 1
inc x = 1 + x
#+END_SRC

Question: Is a function a value?

* What is the arity of a function?

The number of arguments a function takes is its arity.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
# arity 0
def zero ():
  return 0

# arity 1
def inc (x):
  return x + 1

# arity 2
def add (x, y):
  return x + y
#+END_SRC

* Routine vs Function

A routine is an abstraction that do not return a value.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
def a (x):
  print x

def b (x):
  return x
#+END_SRC
a is a routine, b is a function.

A procedure can either be a routine or a function.

* What is a pure function?

A pure function is a side-effect free function that always maps a
given input to the same output.

Which of the following is a pure function?
#+BEGIN_SRC python
def inc (x):
  return x + 1

def one (x):
  print x
  return x

def rand (x):
  # non deterministic!
  return x * random.random()
#+END_SRC

* Immutable vs Mutable

Immutable means that cannot change.
Think "read only".

Persistent Datastructures are immutable,
and can't be updated in-place.

* Referencial Transparency

An expression that is deterministic and without side-effects is
referencially transparent.

It means it can be replaced by its value without changing the
behaviour of the program.

* What is Application?

Calling a function with some arguments is applying that function to
the value of those arguments.

Abstraction and Application are the core concepts of functional
programming.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
f(arg1, arg2)
1 + 2
#+END_SRC
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(f arg1 arg2)
(+ 1 2)
#+END_SRC
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
f arg1 arg2
1 + 2
(+) 1 2
#+END_SRC

* Higher order function

Functions can return functions, and take functions as argument.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
def apply (f, x, y):
  return f(x, y)

apply(add, 1, 2)

def incrementer (n):
  return lambda m: m + n

add2 = incrementer(2)
add2(4)
#+END_SRC

* Partial Application

Take a function of arity n, and m < n arguments,
and return a function of arity n - m.

Example:
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(+ 1 2 3)
((partial +) 1 2 3)
((partial + 1) 2 3)
((partial + 1 2) 3)
((partial + 1 2 3))
#+END_SRC
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
1 + 1
(+) 1 1
((+) 1) 1
-- Currying
#+END_SRC

* Partial Application (bis)
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(defn part [f & args]
  (fn [& rest]
    (apply f (concat args rest))))

((part + 1 2) 3 4)
#+END_SRC

* How to do things?

** map
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(map inc [1 2 3])
#+END_SRC
** filter
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(filter even? [1 2 3 4])
#+END_SRC
** reduce / fold
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(reduce + [1 2 3])
#+END_SRC
** list comprehension
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(for [x (range 1 10) :when (even? x)
      y (range 1 10) :when (odd? y)]
  (* x y))
#+END_SRC
** recursion
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(defn factorial [n]
  (if (zero? n)
    1
    (* n factorial)))
#+END_SRC
** pattern matching
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
factorial 0 = 1
factorial n = n * factorial (n - 1)
#+END_SRC
** function composition
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(def twice (partial * 2))
(def thrice (partial * 3))
(def six-times (comp twice thrice))
#+END_SRC
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
twice = (*) 2
thrice = (*) 3
sixtimes = twice . thrice
#+END_SRC

* What are Types?

Types are sets of values.

1 belongs to several types: it's an Integer, a Number, a Value,
the value 1.

One of the elements of the set of all Values.

One of the elements of the set of all Integers.

The only element in the set of all values that are 1.

1 has the type Value, Integer, Being 1

* What is polymorphism?

** ad hoc polymorphism
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(defrecord Cow [spotted?])
(defrecord Duck [daffy?])
(defmulti talk type)
(defmethod talk Cow [_] "Muuu")
(defmethod talk Duck [_] "Quack Quack")

(talk (map->Cow {:spotted? true}))
(talk (map->Duck {:daffy? true}))
#+END_SRC
** subtyping
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(defrecord Cow [spotted?])
(defrecord Ostrich [height])
(defrecord Duck [daffy?])
(defrecord Goose [silly?])
(defrecord Dog [grumpy?])

(def h
  (-> (make-hierarchy)
      (derive ::bird ::animal)
      (derive Dog ::animal)
      (derive Cow ::animal)
      (derive Duck ::bird)
      (derive Goose ::bird)
      (derive Ostrich ::bird)))

(defn dispatch [v] (type v))

(defmulti flies? #'dispatch :hierarchy #'h)

(defmethod flies? ::animal  [_] false)
(defmethod flies? ::bird    [_] true)
(defmethod flies? Ostrich [_] false)
(defmethod flies? Duck [duck] (not (:daffy? duck)))

(flies? #user.Cow{:spotted? true})
(flies? #user.Goose{:silly? true})
(flies? #user.Ostrich{:height 100})
(flies? #user.Duck{:daffy? true})
(flies? #user.Duck{:daffy? false})
#+END_SRC

** parametric polymorphism
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(defn walk [animal]
  ((get animal :walk) animal))

(walk {:species :Duck,
       :daffy? false,
       :walk (fn [duck]
               (if (:daffy? duck) "run" "wobble"))})
(walk {:species :Horse, :walk (fn [_] "gallop")})

(defn walk-a-lot [animal]
  (take 3 (repeatedly (partial walk animal))))

(walk-a-lot {:species :Duck,
             :daffy? false,
             :walk (fn [duck]
                     (if (:daffy? duck) "run" "wobble"))})
(walk-a-lot {:species :Horse,
             :walk (fn [_] "gallop")})
#+END_SRC
